To solve this, avoid direct use of native modules. Instead, explore the following:

1. **Find Expo-compatible alternatives:** Search for alternative libraries that already have Expo support. Expo's documentation and the community often provide guidance on suitable alternatives.

2. **Use Expo APIs:** If no direct alternative exists, check if Expo provides APIs that could achieve a similar functionality without requiring native module integration.

3. **Switch to Bare Workflow (if necessary):** If the required library is fundamentally incompatible with the managed workflow, consider switching to Expo's bare workflow. This gives you more control but adds more responsibility for configuring the native parts.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Example: Using Expo-compatible alternative)
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera'; // Expo's Camera API

async function takePhoto(){
  const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
  if (status === 'granted') {
    // Use Camera API
  } else {
    console.error('Permission denied.');
  }
}
```
