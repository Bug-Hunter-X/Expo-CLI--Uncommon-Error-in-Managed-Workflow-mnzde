This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or library that's not properly configured or supported within your Expo managed workflow.  It manifests as an error during build or runtime, often related to native modules or platform-specific code.  A common example involves trying to use a library that requires direct interaction with native Android or iOS code without going through the proper Expo APIs or modules. For instance, attempting to directly integrate a native dependency without using Expo's `expo install` and its associated configuration mechanisms would trigger this error.

Example scenario:
Let's say you want to use a third-party library that requires a native module not readily available in Expo's managed workflow.  Directly trying to include and use this library, expecting it to work seamlessly in the managed environment, is likely to cause this issue. 

```javascript
// Attempting to use a native module directly (will likely cause issues)
import { NativeModule } from 'react-native';
const nativeModule = NativeModule.MyNativeModule;
console.log(nativeModule);
```
