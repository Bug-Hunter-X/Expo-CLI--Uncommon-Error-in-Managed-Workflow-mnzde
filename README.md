# Expo CLI: Uncommon Build/Runtime Error in Managed Workflow

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered during development with the Expo CLI within a managed workflow environment. The error typically stems from attempting to utilize libraries or features incompatible with Expo's managed workflow, primarily involving native modules that require direct interaction with Android or iOS code.

## Problem Description

The issue centers around scenarios where developers inadvertently try to include and use native modules without using Expo's designated APIs or methods. The error message can be vague, making debugging challenging.  Expo's managed workflow attempts to provide an abstraction layer over native code, and circumventing this often results in build failures or runtime errors.

## Solution

The primary solution is to ensure compatibility.  If you require a native module, use Expo's compatible APIs or consider alternative libraries that are readily supported within the Expo managed environment.  Switching to a bare workflow might be necessary for maximum flexibility, but comes with additional responsibilities and setup complexities.

## Reproducing the Error

The `bug.js` file contains example code that simulates this issue. By running it, you can observe the error (although specifics might vary depending on your setup).

## Fixing the Error

The `bugSolution.js` shows how the issue can be addressed using Expo's approved methods or alternative approaches.
